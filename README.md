# Chess exercises organizer

Choose an exercise from your chess pgn file and train yourself against the device (at its maximum strength).

## Usage [WIP]

* First, you must set up the engine path in the options page : it must be an UCI-compliant engine (i.e Stockfish).
* Then when starting a game, you will be invited to choose a Pgn file, the game and the players configuration, as well as the time configuration.

## Developers

1. Setup configuration for your OS : https://tauri.studio/en/docs/getting-started/intro
2. `npm install` or `yarn` in order to install dependencies locally (first time).
4. `npm run serve` or `yarn serve` for a dev environment.
